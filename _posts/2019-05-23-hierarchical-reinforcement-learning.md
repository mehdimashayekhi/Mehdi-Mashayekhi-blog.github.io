## What is Reinforcement learning (RL)

Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—mapping states to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward. The learner is not told which actions to perform, but instead must learn which actions lead to the most reward by trying them. Actions not only may affect the immediate reward, but also the next situation and, through that, all future rewards. Trial-and-error searching, and delayed reward—are the two most important unique features of reinforcement learning.


### Notations

Here is a list of notations to help you read through equations in the post easily.

{: class="info"}
| Symbol | Meaning |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| $$s \in \mathcal{S}$$ | States. |
| $$a \in \mathcal{A}$$ | Actions. |
| $$r \in \mathcal{R}$$ | Rewards. |
| $$S_t, A_t, R_t$$ | State, action, and reward at time step t of one trajectory. I may occasionally use $$s_t, a_t, r_t$$ as well. |
| $$\gamma$$ | Discount factor; penalty to uncertainty of future rewards; $$0<\gamma \leq 1$$. |
| $$G_t$$ | Return; or discounted future reward; $$G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$. |
| $$P(s’, r \vert s, a)$$ | Transition probability of getting to the next state s’ from the current state s with action a and reward r. |
| $$\pi(a \vert s)$$ | Stochastic policy (agent behavior strategy); $$\pi_\theta(.)$$ is a policy parameterized by θ. |
| $$\mu(s)$$ | Deterministic policy; we can also label this as $$\pi(s)$$, but using a different letter gives better distinction so that we can easily tell when the policy is stochastic or deterministic without further explanation. Either $$\pi$$ or $$\mu$$ is what a reinforcement learning algorithm aims to learn. |
| $$V(s)$$ | State-value function measures the expected return of state s; $$V_w(.)$$ is a value function parameterized by w.|
| $$V^\pi(s)$$ | The value of state s when we follow a policy π; $$V^\pi (s) = \mathbb{E}_{a\sim \pi} [G_t \vert S_t = s]$$. |
| $$Q(s, a)$$ | Action-value function is similar to $$V(s)$$, but it assesses the expected return of a pair of state and action (s, a); $$Q_w(.)$$ is a action value function parameterized by w. |
| $$Q^\pi(s, a)$$ | Similar to $$V^\pi(.)$$, the value of (state, action) pair when we follow a policy π; $$Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{a\sim \pi} [G_t \vert S_t = s, A_t = a]$$. |
| $$A(s, a)$$ | Advantage function, $$A(s, a) = Q(s, a) - V(s)$$; it can be considered as another version of Q-value with lower variance by taking the state-value off as the baseline. |
| $$I_o(s)$$ | An initiation function (precondition) for an option. |
| $$\pi_o(a \vert s)$$ | An internal policy (behavior) for an option. |
| $$\beta_o(s)$$ | a termination function (post-condition) for an option. |

### Some of Main Ingredients of Reinforcement Learning
- Value Functions
- Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
- Advantage Function

### Main limitations of RL

- Data inefficiency
- Scaling
- Generalization
- Abstraction

## What is Hierarchical Reinforcement learning (HRL)
Imagine you want to build a cooking robot. In order for the robot to cook we can imagine various levels of action abstraction:
- High-level actions: choosing a recipe, making a grocery list, getting groceries and finally cook.
- Medium-level actions: getting a pot, putting ingredients in the  pot, string until smooth, checking the recipe  
- Low-level actions: wrist and arm movement while stirring, pouring

All these steps have to be seamlessly integrated. Dividing the actions into various levels of abstraction is called temporal abstraction. 
Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising method which extends conventional reinforcement learning approaches, by exploiting temporal abstraction-- multiple-time step ``macro`` actions.
Temporal abstraction allows us to only exploring/computing values for interesting states, and transfer learning across problems/regions.


## HRL Algorithms

In the following we deep dive into one of the most important HRL algorithms which is ``Options Framework``, and summarize some of other HRL algorithms.



### Options Framework

[[paper](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/Sutton-Precup-Singh-AIJ99.pdf)\|[code](https://github.com/mehdimashayekhi/Some-RL-Implementation)]

**Option** is defined by a tuple tuple ($$I_o(s)$$, $$\pi_o(a \vert s)$$, $$\beta_o(s)$$).

#### MonteCarlo Model Learning
What is meant by model learning is to determine the transition dynamics of an option (i.e., $$p_{ss’}^{o}$$), and the expected reward under an option (i.e., $$r_s^{o}$$), given experience and knowledge of $$o$$ (i.e., of its $$I$$, $$\pi$$, and $$\beta$$)
#### Intra-Option Model Learning
For Markov options, special temporal-difference methods can be used to learn usefully about the model of an option before the option terminates. We call these intra-option methods.
