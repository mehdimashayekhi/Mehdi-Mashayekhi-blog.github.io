> Deep neural networks are usually over-parametrized which leads to high computational cost and memory overhead at inference time. In this post we are going to review some background and recent pruning algorithms.

## Background on Pruning Algorithms

The most popular pruning algorithms are OBD and OBS. Both of these algorithms are based on constructing a local model of the loss function and analytically predict the effect of perturbing the parameter vectors. They approximate the loss function L by a Taylor series. A perturbation delta theta of the parameter will change the loss function by: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta \mathcal{L} =  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta}^{T}\Delta \Theta
\end{aligned}
$$
