> (WIP)Recently there has been a significant progress in regards to unsupervised representation learning in the domain of natural language processing such as OpenAI-GPT, BERT, Transformer-XL, and XLNet. XLNet has achieved SOTA performance on many NLP tasks. Just shortly after XLNet, Facebook AI’s model RoBERTa, outperformed XLNet on GLUE benchmark. The backbone of all these models is based on attention, and language modeling. In my opinion, there are really some interesting ideas in the XLNet paper, and in this post we are going to review this model, and look at some code snippets to fully understand the ideas present in the paper.

## Background
Recently there has been a significant progress in regards to unsupervised representation learning in the domain of natural language processing such as [OpenAI GPT](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/), and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). Among different unsupervised pre-training objectives, autoregressive (**AR**) language modeling and autoencoding (**AE**) have been the two most successful pre-training objectives. 

AR language modeling estimates the probability distribution of a text corpus with an autoregressive model. Specifically, given a text sequence $$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_T)$$,  AR language
modeling factorizes the likelihood into a forward product $$p(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{t=1}^T p(x_{t}\mid \mathbf{x}_{<t})$$ or a backward one $$p(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{t=1}^T p(x_{t}\mid \mathbf{x}_{>t})$$.

AR language modeling maximizes the likelihood under the following forward autoregressive factorization:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max_{\theta} \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_\theta(x_t\mid \mathbf{x}_{<t})= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log  \frac{\exp({h_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{1:t-1})}^\top e(x_t))}{\sum_{x'} \exp({h_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{1:t-1})}^\top e(x'))}
\end{aligned}
$$

There has been some attempts for bidirectional AR language modeling such as [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365). ElLMo simply concatenated the left-to-right and right-to-left information, meaning that the representation couldn’t take advantage of both left and right contexts simultaneously.

In contrast, AE based pretraining does not perform density estimation, but it works towards reconstructing the original data from corrupted input. BERT is a notable example of AE. BERT replaces language modeling with a modified objective called “masked language modeling”. In this model, words in a sentence are randomly erased and replaced with a special token `[MASK]` with some small probability. Then, the model is trained to recover the erased tokens.  As density estimation is not part of the objective, BERT can utilize bidirectional contexts for reconstruction which also closes the bidirectional information gap in AR language modeling and improves performance.

BERT optimizes the following objective by reconstructing the masked tokens from the corrupted input: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max_{\theta} \log p_\theta(\mathbf{\bar{x}} \mid \hat{\mathbf{x}}) \approx \sum_{t=1}^{T} m_{t} \log p_\theta(x_t\mid \mathbf{\hat{x}})= \sum_{t=1}^{T} m_{t} \log  \frac{\exp({H_{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{t})}^\top e(x_t))}{\sum_{x'} \exp({H_{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{t})}^\top e(x'))}
\end{aligned}
$$

Even though BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches that are based on autoregressive language modeling, there are two main issues with BERT. One is discrepancy between pretraining and fine tuning, since the `[MASK]` tokens are absent during fine tuning. Second is, BERT assumes the predicted tokens are independent of each other given the unmasked tokens.

Considering these pros and cons of AR and AE, the researchers from CMU and Google proposed [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08237.pdf), a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that leverages the best these two modeling. More specifically, XLNet offers the following advantages: 

1. Enables learning bidirectional contexts by simply maximizing the expected likelihood over **all possible permutations of the factorization order**. In contrast to a fixed forward or backward factorization. As a result, in expectation, each position learns to utilize contextual information from all positions, i.e., and captures bidirectional context. 
2. Since it does not rely on data corruption, it does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy
3. Eliminating the independence assumption, since the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens. 
4. Incorporating ideas from Transformer-XL including Segment-level Recurrence, and Relative Positional Encodings.
5. Because the factorization order is arbitrary and the target is ambiguous, a new reformulation of the Transformer-XL model is needed to eliminate the ambiguity. 

In the following we will go over the details of the XLNet model and its implementation.
