> (WIP)Recently there has been a significant progress in regards to unsupervised representation learning in the domain of natural language processing such as OpenAI-GPT, BERT, Transformer-XL, and XLNet. XLNet has achieved SOTA performance on many NLP tasks. Just shortly after XLNet, Facebook AIâ€™s model RoBERTa, outperformed XLNet on GLUE benchmark. The backbone of all these models is based on attention, and language modeling. In my opinion, there are really some interesting ideas in the XLNet paper, and in this post we are going to review this model, and look at some code snippets to fully understand the ideas present in the paper.

## Language Modeling Background
TBD

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max_{\theta} \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_\theta(x_t\mid \mathbf{x}_{<t})= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log  \frac{\exp({h_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{1:t-1})}^\top e(x_t))}{\sum_{x'} \exp({h_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{1:t-1})}^\top e(x'))}
\end{aligned}
$$
